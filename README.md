# DTSC 3601 - OpenAI Coding Assignment 4
# I hit the free modal limit and was unable to provide a modal link, however the code should still work if you run it locally with Streamlit. 
# I made sure to use the Supabases's anon public key so it should work.
For this project I built a pipeline that takes in data, cleans it up with an LLM, saves it to Supabase, and then shows it in Streamlit. I first tried using sports data from the Detroit Lions page, but the data there wasn’t in HTML so the scraper failed. I then tried Pro-Football-Reference since it’s plain HTML, but that site blocked the request with 403 errors. I also tried Wikipedia directly but hit the same problem, so I switched to downloading the page as a PDF and scraping it from there instead. The LLM was helpful because it took the messy text from the PDF and turned it into a clean JSON object with a title, summary, keywords, and timestamps, which saved me from writing a ton of custom parsing code. After that I pushed the JSON into Supabase and connected it to a Streamlit app where I could make tables and charts, like a GDP pie chart grouped by continent. Along the way there were some issues with Supabase not liking arrays, fixing the loader to parse keywords correctly, and also hitting the Modal free limit when deploying. Even with those problems, I got the system working and showing how an LLM can clean raw text into usable data.
